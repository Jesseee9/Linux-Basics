# Linux-Basics
A personal, public notebook to save Linux commands as I learn them.

Purpose
- Quick personal reference for commands I learn.
- Public so employers can see my learning progress.

How to use
- Open docs/commands.md to find saved commands.
- Each entry uses a small template so it stays easy to read.

Repo structure
- README.md — this overview
- docs/commands.md — one file with all commands (keeps it simple)

Command entry template
- Command: name
- Purpose: one short sentence
- Syntax: basic form
- Example: one or two real examples
- Notes: short tips or common flags

How to add a command
- Edit docs/commands.md and add a new entry using the template.
- Commit message suggestion: docs: add <command> — short note

License
- No license chosen (personal notes). Add a license later if you want.
